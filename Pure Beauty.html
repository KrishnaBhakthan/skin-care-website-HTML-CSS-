 <h2><u>1)Cleanser</u></h2>
 <p>Cleansing helps remove excess oil, makeup, sweat, dirt and dead skin cells from your skin. It refreshes your skin and gives your complexion a chance to breathe. It also creates a clean foundation for you to apply products like face moisturizer or makeup.</p>
<p><b>How to Do Face Clean-Up at Home</b><br>
   *Cleanse. This step includes washing your face with lukewarm water and a face cleanser. <br>
   *Steam. Taking steam increases oil production that naturally moisturises your face and unclogs pores.<br>
   *Scrub.<br>
   *Apply Face Pack. </p></div>
<div class="div2">
   <h2><u>2)Toner</u></h2>
   <p>A toner's job is meant to gently refresh your skin without stripping it of its natural moisture. This means toner won't irritate sensitive skin or cause excessive dryness. Toner also prepares the skin to drink up your post-cleansing moisturizer and any other skin treatments that you may apply.</p>
  <p>Using a toner is an important step in a good skincare regimen. Toner simultaneously cleanses, moisturizes, shrinks pores, balances your skin’s pH, and adds a layer of protection against impurities.[1] When adding toner to your daily skin care regimen, make sure to apply it between cleansing and moisturizing. Use a cotton pad to gently spread toner over your face and neck. When choosing your toner, look for gentle, natural ingredients that won’t dry your face out. You can also make your own toner at home tailored exactly to your skin’s needs.
</p></div>
  <div class="div2">
   <h2><u>3)Serums</u></h2>
   <p>Face serums often contain active ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycolic acid and they're very useful for targeting specific skin concerns, such as acne, dryness, clogged pores, dullness, dark spots and more. In short, if you're not using one, you're not making the most out of your skin care routine.</p>

  </div><div class="div2">
   <h2><u>4)Eye creams</u></h2>
   <p>Eye creams are moisturizers that are specially formulated for use on the delicate skin around your eyes. Face moisturizers and eye creams are not always interchangeable. Always read the product label and carefully choose formulas that are suitable for use around the eyes.</p>
  <p><b>Best way to apply eye cream</b><br>
   1)Use your ring finger.<br>
   2)Scoop up a pea-sized amount of product.<br>
   3)Gently tap small dots under your eyes, starting in the innermost corner and moving outward.<br>
   4)Pat the product into your skin.<br>
   5)Wait 2 minutes to let the cream fully absorb.<br>
   6)Apply the rest of your skin care products and makeup</p></div><div class="div2">
   <h2><u>5)Moisturizer</u></h2>
   <p>Moisturizers improve skin barrier repair, maintain skin's integrity and appearance by acting as humectants, emollients, and occlusives, each with its own mechanism of action.</p>
  <p><b>How to Apply Moisturizer: Step by Step</b> <br> 
   Follow this step-by-step guide on the best way to apply moisturizer.  <br> 
   
   Step One: Wash Your Face  <br> 
   
   Prep for moisturizing by washing your face. Use a gentle, nourishing cleanser that adequately removes sweat, dirt, oil, makeup, and any lingering skincare products. In face washes for oily skin, also look for active ingredients that clarify the pores and gently exfoliate the skin.
   
   “It is important to always make sure to moisturize skin after it has been properly cleansed, as you want to make sure you are applying product to a surface that is free of bacteria, makeup, and other buildup,” Dr. Garshick explains.
   
   Gently pat dry, but don’t remove all moisture. <br> 
   
   Step Two: Apply Other Skincare Products from Lightest to Heaviest  <br> 
   
   If you have a full-fledged skincare routine that includes toners, serums, essences, and/or treatment products, apply your products in order of lightest to heaviest consistency while your skin is still damp. 
   
   Note that this doesn’t include sunscreen or makeup. Also, if you’re using a wash-off skincare treatment—such as a face mask or peel—apply that after cleansing and then rinse and apply your other products in proper order. 
   
   If you don’t use other skincare products, you can skip this step. <br> 
   
   Step Three: Apply Your Moisturizer   <br> 
   
   After slathering your other skincare products, you can apply moisturizer. Aim for about a quarter-size amount and make sure to reach every area, including your ears, hairline, neck, and decolletage. </p></div><div class="div2">
   <h2><u>6)Faceoil</u></h2>
   <p>Face Oil Helps to Brighten the Complexion.
      Botanical facial oils are rich in antioxidants and vitamins that help to reduce the appearance of dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and other skin discolorations. Face oils also improve the overall tone of dull skin, leaving it looking more radiant and youthful.</p>
  <p> <b>How to Apply Face Oils</b><br>
   When is the best time to apply oils? How much oil should you be using? What other products should you be using in combination with your oils? Here are some basic tips to help you get the most out of your face oils.<br>
   
   1. Combine Oils With Serums or Moisturizers<br>
   Inas Anis—nurse practitioner, esthetician and anti-aging skin care specialist—advises that oils “can be combined with other products to get enhanced effects.” The best combinations: serums (to treat) or moisturizers (to lock in hydration).
   <br>2. Apply Based on Your Skin’s Needs
   Beauty blogger Renee (of Gothamista) advises to use oils after applying your face serum(s) and, if necessary, use oils to spot-treat dry areas—rather than applying all over the face.
   
   Anis notes that, depending on your skin type, you may only want to use oils before bed so that your skin can soak them up overnight and provide protection throughout the day. This is especially true for oils that can increase your skin’s sensitivity to light or thicker oils that might give your complexion a little too much shine for a daytime look. If you have dull skin, Anis also suggests using face oil as a primer before applying makeup. Allow the oil to fully absorb before applying your makeup for a natural, hydrated glow.
   
   Dr. Alex Roher, MD of San Diego Botox Inc recommends using face oils both in the morning and at night. He advises applying oil as the last step of your nighttime skin care routine and before your sunscreen and makeup in the morning.
   
   <br>3. Dab or Pat Oils Into Your Skin<br>
   Anis and Renee both agree that you shouldn’t be rubbing the oils into your skin like you would a moisturizer. Instead, dab or pat the oils, pushing them into your pores, rather than just sliding them around on the skin’s surface. This will help your skin absorb the oil and make use of its benefits much quicker.
   
   <br>4. A Couple Drops Is All You Need<br>
   Because face oils contain such concentrated amounts of nutrients (Marula oil has four times the vitamin C as an orange!), a little bit goes a long way. One to three drops of your choice of oil is enough to cover your whole face and deliver the benefits your skin needs</p></div><div class="div2">
   <h2><u>7)Sunscreen</u></h2>
   <p>Sunscreen use can help prevent skin cancer by protecting you from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Anyone can get skin cancer, regardless of age, gender, or skin tone. In fact, it is estimated that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.
   </p>
   <p><b>How To Apply Sunscreen</b><br>
      1)Shake well before use to mix particles that might be clumped up in the container.<br>
      2)Be sure to apply enough sunscreen. <br>
      3)Use on all parts of your skin exposed to the sun, including the ears, back, shoulders, and the back of the knees and legs.<br>
      4)Apply thickly and thoroughly.</p>
